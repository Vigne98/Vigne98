I am a 24 years old guy studying for an English degree. I got interested into Software Testing because of an open position in Game Testing which I decided to apply for, but after a long thought I realized how few my knowledge of Testing were and I decided to start reading about it and apply into a bootcamp course for software testing. Start learning about Software Development was the beggining of it all. I'm currently playing with Web3 - Smart Contract design.

I personally don't like to refer as skills the knowledge on certain specific software just because of how foggy the sight may become in a constant learning environment. There's no a concrete way to mesaure the "level" of knowledge that someone has if not but it's projects. I don't believe in years of experience but in project experience or proven knowledge instead.
Still, most people like to mesaure they knowledge in the most subjective way possible, so here's an idea of key concepts that may give you an idea of the tools or practice I used/know.
